# Technohacks_Task-1_Diabetes-_Prediction


To predict if a person has diabetes or not using a dataset containing medical data, you can follow these steps:

Data Preparation: Start by loading and preprocessing your dataset. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables if needed, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that might influence the prediction of diabetes. Common features include glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, etc.

Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning model for binary classification. Popular models for this task include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM).

Model Training: Train your selected model on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using the testing data. Common evaluation metrics for binary classification include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Prediction: Finally, use the trained model to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on their medical data.
